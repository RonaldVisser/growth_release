# Growth release

This small script creates a figure with the growth releases that were
detected in the late Roman material from Cuyk and Gennep in the
Netherlands. This was originaly published as (Visser 2010), but this
article is reworked and updated as a chapter for my PhD-thesis. The code
and analyses were also made reproducible.

The data used consists of the measurements CUY01031 and CUY01091 from
Cuyk (Spoor-Hanraets, Vernimmen and Jansma n.d.) and from Gennep the
measurement GEP00281 (Rijn and Jansma n.d.) was used.
