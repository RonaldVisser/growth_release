# Growth release

This small script creates a figure with the growth releases present in the late Roman material from Cuyk and Gennep in the Netherlands. This was originaly published as [@visser2010], but this article is reworked and updated as a chapter for my PhD-thesis. The code and analyses were also made reproducible.

The data used consists of the measurements CUY01031 and CUY01091 from Cuyk [@spoor-hanraets] and from Gennep the measurement GEP00281 [@vanrijn] was used.
